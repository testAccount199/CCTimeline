Unit tests for major components

See if we can use the MediaPlayer playingCallback

lastPlaybackCaption vs TimelineData.lastSelectedCaption - 

SelectCaption should be able to handle null -

Create two parallel branches for looping and not looping

Unit testing

Focus on first caption on startup -

Very short timelines don't fill properly - 

get rid of Caption.SecondsToWidthConversion - 
Timespan to width - 

Caption class should just be plain data - 




Configure Assembly signing in cake file

Selecting caption should move playhead


---------

- Navigate on selection
- don't pause on seek
- tab select should work if repeat mode is on
- delete caption, overlay goes away
- tab always jumps to right of playhead
- gray out everything after the timeline ends
Allow deeper zoom in, cap zoom out to max duration
Max zoom should show one frame per tick
- Caption start and duration values bound to status bar *
- Status bar forecolor should be a gray not a white "start: {}, end: {}" *
Gentle snap to default zoom - click line to get 100%

scale drag velocity with zoom

- Ribbon shortcut keys *

- overlay on resize
- click caption when playing


- Zoom drag velocity bug fix * 
ruler regime change bug
 - add new caption *
- selected caption color *
- ruler forgeround color *

- Ask about ruler foreground color - switch to main storyline timeline *
Mountain zoom slider

- clicking on caption should give focus to editable box* 

- light selection blue instead of teal for selected caption

- looping shouldn't turn off on selection (2 screenshots for each color)
